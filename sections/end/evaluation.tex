\subsubsection{Inhibition}
The authors of \cite{SNN} note, that they chose a 1:1 excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio, rather than the biologically plausible 4:1 ratio, 
to reduce computional complexity.
The arcitecture present causes inhibition of all other excitatory neurons when a neuron spikes and thus, 
creates a soft winner-take-all mechanism.
