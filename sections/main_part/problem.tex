Since \acp{SNN} are not only influenced by the input values but also by temporal dependencies of these inputs, algorithms aiming to optimise their parameters are rare.
Moreover, researchers working with \acp{SNN} focus on biologically plausible methods and therefore refuse to use conventional techniques like gradient descent.
